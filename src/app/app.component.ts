    /*
    Why use BehaviorSubject?
    This specialized subject is ideal when you want to maintain and provide a "current value" to subscribers.
    Think of it as a scoreboard in a basketball game.
    Even if you join watching in the middle of the game,
    you'll still see the current score. Similarly,
    when a new observer subscribes to a BehaviorSubject, 
    it immediately receives the current value (or the last value that was emitted).

    It's important to remember that a BehaviorSubject requires an initial value upon instantiation.
    This is where it differs from a regular Subject which doesn't have an initial value.
    Picture a newly installed scoreboard â€“ with BehaviorSubject,
    you set a starting score, say 0-0. With a regular Subject,
    the board remains blank until a point is scored.
    Subscribers (early or late) of a normal Subject will not receive emissions until the Subject emits a value.

    Contrasting with ReplaySubject, while both provide historical values,
    ReplaySubject can relay multiple previous values, not just the last one.
    If the basketball scoreboard could show the last five scores in the match sequence,
    that'd be akin to ReplaySubject. ReplaySubject also does not receive an initial seed value.

    In conclusion, if you need to ensure subscribers always get the latest value upon subscription,
    or you have an initial seed value, BehaviorSubject is your pick.
    If you need more historical emissions, consider ReplaySubject.
    And if you don't need any history at all, a simple Subject might be what you're looking for.
